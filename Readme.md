## Development

Run `yarn dev` to start the next.js server and open up http://localhost:3000.

To get hot reloading of markdown files run `yarn write` in a new Terminal tab
alongside the next.js server to start the file watcher.

If you add a new markdown file, you'll have to restart the server (`yarn dev`)
to pick up the changes. Pretty sure you don't have to restart the markdown
watcher (`yarn write`) but I have been known to be wrong from time to time.
